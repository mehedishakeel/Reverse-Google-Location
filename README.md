# Reverse-Google-Location
Getting Reverse Google Location (Addresses) By Latitude and Longitude using Google GeocodingAPI. Convert addresses or Place IDs to latitude/longitude coordinates and vice-versa.
This project is created using php & JavaScript to call the API through web browser. We have to add own Google Geocoding API key in PHP file. As an input we have to enter the Latitude and Longitude and in return we will get the Human Readable Address.
 
# What is Google Geocoding API?
The Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map. Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address. You can also use the Geocoding API to find the address for a given place ID.

Full API Documentation: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding

Geocoding API request and response (latitude/longitude lookup): https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&key=YOUR_API_KEY

You can test this by entering the URL into your web browser (be sure to replace ‘YOUR_API_KEY’ with your actual API key). The response includes a human-readable address for the latitude and longitude location.

Thank You!!!
